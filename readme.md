# US Colleges API

This is an open API for accessing the names and locations of accredited colleges and universities in the United States.

## Technical Details
- The list of colleges is retrieved from [ope.ed.gov](https://ope.ed.gov/accreditation/GetDownloadFile.aspx), and the last update was in March 2016.
- I standardized fields based on [Schema.org's CollegeOrUniversity object](https://schema.org/CollegeOrUniversity). Not all fields are currently supported and I had to add a couple special ones, so check the migrations files for a list of supported fields.
